When they finally reach New York City, Kong is put on display in a Beauty and the Beast farce, bound in chains with a large crown on his head. When Kong sees a group of reporters crowding around Dwan, hoping for interviews, the ape thinks it is an assault on Dwan and breaks free of his bonds and goes on a rampage throughout the city. In the commotion, Wilson is killed when Kong steps on him. The ape also destroys an elevated train in his search for Dwan. Prescott and Dwan flee across the Queensboro Bridge to Manhattan while Kong pursues them. Prescott calls the military and in return for a promise that Kong will be captured unharmed, he tells them that Kong will climb the World Trade Center, which resembles a mountain on his native island. Kong locates Dwan and takes her; he begins to make his way to the World Trade Center, with Jack and the military in hot pursuit.",

However, victory remained elusive until the recent Battle of Verdun, which was secured by the celebrated war hero Sergeant Rita Vrataski.In Britain, the UDF amasses forces for a major invasion of France.

He is assigned to Master Sergeant Farell and the misfit J-Squad, who dislike and belittle him. The following day, the invasion forces land on a French beach but are ambushed and massacred by Mimics.

Joseph Cooper, a widowed former NASA test pilot, works as a farmer and raises his children, Murph and Tom, alongside his father-in-law Donald. Cooper is reprimanded by Murph's teachers for telling her that the Apollo missions were not fabricated. During a dust storm, the two discover that dust patterns in Murph's room, which she first attributes to a ghost, result from a gravitational anomaly, and translate them into geographic coordinates. These lead them to a secret NASA facility headed by Professor John Brand, who explains that 48 years earlier, a wormhole appeared near Saturn, leading to a system in another galaxy with 12 potentially habitable planets located near a black hole named Gargantua. Volunteers of the Lazarus expedition had previously traveled through the wormhole to evaluate the planets, with three — Miller, Edmunds, and Mann — reporting back desirable results.",

Her new boyfriend, Dr. Leonard Samson, contacts Ross who soon arrives with his forces and Blonsky. They attack Banner at the university and he transforms into the Hulk again. Blonsky, whose judgement is impaired by the serum, attacks and mocks the Hulk. The Hulk severely injures Blonsky, but the serum allows him to heal quickly. Betty is almost killed by military fire and is saved by the Hulk, who flees with Betty and eventually reverts to Banner. The pair go on the run, and Banner contacts Mr. Blue who urges them to meet him in New York City. Mr. Blue is cellular biologist Dr. Samuel Sterns, who has developed a possible antidote to Banner's condition. After a seemingly successful test, he warns Banner that the antidote may only reverse an initial transformation. Sterns reveals that he has synthesized Banner's blood samples, which Banner sent from Brazil, into a large supply, and wants to apply its \"limitless potential\" to medicine. Fearful of the Hulk's power falling into the wrong hands, Banner wants to destroy the supply.",

As Banner and Betty are taken away in a helicopter, Blonsky stays behind and orders Sterns to inject him with Banner's blood, as he covets the Hulk's power. The experiment mutates Blonsky into the Abomination, a monstrous creature with size and strength surpassing that of the Hulk. He attacks Sterns, who gets some of Banner's blood in a cut on his forehead and begins mutating as well. The Abomination rampages through Harlem. Realizing that the Hulk is the only one who can stop the Abomination, Banner convinces Ross to release him. He jumps from Ross's helicopter and transforms after hitting the ground. The Hulk defeats the Abomination by nearly strangling him to death with a chain, but spares his life upon hearing Betty's plea. The Hulk leaves the Abomination for Ross and his forces to arrest and flees New York.\n\nA month later, Banner is in Bella Coola, British Columbia, where he practices transforming in a controlled manner. Sometime later, Tony Stark approaches Ross at a bar and informs him that a team is being put together.[c]",

Three clairvoyant humans (\"precogs\") receive psychic impressions of an impending homicide, and officers analyze their visions to determine the location and apprehend the perpetrator before the crime can occur. Would-be killers are placed in an electrically induced coma and held in a panopticon-like prison facility. Although Precrime has eliminated nearly all premeditated murders during its six-year existence, spontaneous crimes of passion called \"red ball\" killings still occur, giving the police only a short time to act. Precrime chief John Anderton led a tactical unit to take down an angry husband who tried to kill his wife and lover after discovering their affair.",

These discrepancies are purged from the official record to maintain the precogs' reputation of infallibility, but the precogs retain their memories.

Anne, a neuroin addict and Agatha's mother, had given up custody of Agatha; some time later, she broke her habit and tried to reclaim her daughter. Desperate to preserve Precrime, Burgess hired a man to kill Anne, knowing that Precrime would intervene, then killed her himself in the predicted manner afterward. The Precrime technicians, trained to disregard the second murder vision as an echo of the first one, deleted the record. Once Anderton began to investigate, Burgess arranged for Crow to pose as Sean's abductor in order to provoke Anderton to murder.\n\nA \"red ball\" report comes in, indicating that Burgess will kill Anderton. As the two men face each other down, Anderton points out the dilemma facing Burgess: he can spare Anderton and watch Precrime be discredited and shut down, or validate the program by killing him and going to prison. Burgess asks Anderton's forgiveness before killing himself.",

There she is offered to Kong, who is revealed to be a giant gorilla-like beast. Kong carries a terrified Ann away into the jungle as Denham, Jack, and some crewmen give chase. The men encounter living dinosaurs; they manage to kill a charging Stegosaurus, but are attacked by an aggressive Brontosaurus and eventually Kong himself, leaving Jack and Denham as the only survivors. After Kong slays a Tyrannosaurus to save Ann, Jack keeps following them while Denham returns to the village. Upon arriving in Kong's mountain lair, Ann is menaced by a serpent-like Elasmosaurus, which Kong also kills. When a Pteranodon tries to fly away with Ann, and is killed by Kong, Jack saves her and they climb down a vine dangling from a cliff ledge. When Kong starts pulling them back up, the two drop into the water below; they flee back to the village, where Denham, Englehorn, and the surviving crewmen await. Kong pursues, breaks open the gate, and relentlessly rampages through the village",

Skynet sends the T-1000—an advanced, shape-shifting prototype Terminator made of virtually indestructible liquid metal—back in time to kill resistance leader John Connor when he is a child. To protect John, the resistance sends back a reprogrammed T-800 Terminator, a less advanced metal endoskeleton covered in living tissue.In 1995 Los Angeles, John's mother Sarah is incarcerated in Pescadero State Hospital for her violent efforts to prevent \"Judgment Day\"—the prophesied events of August 29, 1997, when Skynet will gain sentience and, in response to its creators' attempts to deactivate it, incite a nuclear holocaust. John, living with foster parents, also considers Sarah delusional and resents her efforts to prepare him for his future role. The T-1000 locates John in a shopping mall, but the T-800 intervenes, coming to John's aid and enabling his escape. John calls to warn his foster parents, but the T-800 deduces that the T-1000 has already killed them",

Against advice from his friend and erstwhile criminal partner Danny Ocean, he becomes involved with investor and casino mogul Willy Bank, whose thugs strongarm Reuben into signing over his ownership stake. As a result, Tishkoff suffers a heart attack and becomes bedridden. Ocean offers Bank a chance to set things right, but Bank refuses and completes the hotel, renamed \"The Bank\". To avenge Tishkoff, Ocean gathers his crew to ruin Bank on the hotel's opening night. The crew's plan has two objectives:While they can implement various rigging mechanisms into the casino, Danny and his crew can be stopped by the Greco, a state-of-the-art artificial intelligence computer system that monitors gamblers' biometric responses and detects cheating. To disrupt the Greco, they plan to use a magnetron disguised as a cell phone as a gift to Bank.

China interprets this as \"use weapon\", prompting them to break off communications, and other nations follow. Banks argues that the symbol interpreted as \"weapon\" can be more abstractly related to the concepts of \"means\" or \"tool\"; China's translation likely results from interacting with the heptapods using mahjong, a highly competitive game. Meanwhile, the Russian team receives a message that they translate as \"there is no time,\" which they interpret as a possible threat.\n\nRogue soldiers plant a bomb in the Montana craft. Unaware, Banks and Donnelly reenter the alien vessel, and the aliens give them a more complex message.

At the event, General Shang thanks Banks for persuading him to stop the attack when she called his private number and recited his wife's dying words.[a] He then shows her his private number and whispers his wife's words into her ear.\n\nIn the present, Banks takes CIA agent Halpern's satellite phone from a table and calls Shang's private number to recite the words. The Chinese announce that they are standing down and releasing their twelfth of the message. The other countries follow suit, and the twelve spacecraft depart.\n\nFrom what she has learned, Banks writes and publishes a book called The Universal Language, a guide to the heptapod language, which will eventually teach humanity to perceive time the same way as the heptapods.",

The ship splits in two, and the stern sinks into the freezing water with the remaining passengers. Jack helps Rose onto floating debris and makes her promise to survive and live a full life. Jack dies from hypothermia, but Rose is saved by a returning lifeboat and rescued by the RMS Carpathia. Rose hides from Cal and her mother and gives her name as Rose Dawson on her arrival in New York City.",

Her son Harry is a heroin addict, along with his friend Tyrone. The two deal heroin in a bid to realize their dreams; Harry and his girlfriend Marion plan to open a clothing store for Marion's designs, while Tyrone seeks the approval of his mother and an escape from the ghetto. When Sara receives a call that she has been invited to appear on her favorite game show (presumably a scam, prank call, or delusion on her part), she begins a restrictive crash diet, hoping to fit into a red dress that she wore at Harry's graduation.At the advice of her friend Rae, Sara visits a physician who prescribes her amphetamines to control her appetite. She begins losing weight rapidly and is excited by how much energy she has. When Harry recognizes the signs of her drug abuse and implores her to stop taking the amphetamines, Sara insists that the chance to appear on television and the increased admiration from her friends Ada and Rae are her remaining reasons to live",

Leonard swaps clothes with Jimmy, hearing him whisper \"Sammy\". As Leonard has only told Sammy's story to those he has met, he suddenly doubts Jimmy's role in his wife's murder. Teddy arrives and asserts that Jimmy was John G, but when Leonard is undeterred, Teddy reveals that he helped him kill the real attacker a year ago, and Teddy has been using Leonard ever since. Teddy points out that since the name \"John G\" is common, Leonard will cyclically forget and begin his search again and that even Teddy himself has a \"John G\" name. Further, Teddy reveals that Sammy's story is Leonard's own story, a memory Leonard has repressed to escape feelings of guilt.",

The human and ape survivors of the struggle left the ship, and their descendants are the people Leo has encountered since landing. The apes arrive and attack the humans who have gathered to see Leo, although he evens the odds when he uses the Oberon's last fragments of fuel to fire a final blast at the first wave of apes. The battle stops when a familiar vehicle descends from the sky, which Leo immediately identifies as the pod piloted by Pericles, the chimpanzee astronaut who was pushed in time as Leo was and had just now found his way to the planet, the electromagnetic storm releasing people from it in an opposite direction in time to their entrance because they were traveling backward not forward in time. When Pericles lands and the pod opens, the apes bow, interpreting his arrival as the return of Semos, and hostilities between humans and apes suddenly cease.",

The team stakes out the depository and subsequently breaks in, but when a careless officer makes a noise, McCauley aborts the heist.
